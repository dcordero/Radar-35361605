# Summary
AVPlayerViewController does not react to the pause button when playing a live stream.

# Steps to Reproduce
Attached project which plays a live stream. 

When running the project in tvOS 10 the stream can be paused using the Play/Pause button in Siri Remote.

When running the same project in tvOS 11, the stream can NOT be paused. The following error appears in the console log.

```

```

Notes:

AVPlayerViewController does not actually allow pausing when playing a live stream with a sliding window smaller than 76 seconds.

# Expected Results
